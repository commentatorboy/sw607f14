For the last few years, Software 6 students have worked on a series of applications under the common name GIRAF. These applications are designed to help people suffering from autistic spectrum disorder and their guardians throughout their day.

 This report covers the development of the application Sekvens, designed to help create series of activities through sequences of pictograms. The program is taken from a state where it effectively was a standalone application, to a near final product, tied into the GIRAF solution.
 
 This includes setting it up with GIRAF and a common database. Furthermore, there has been development of additional features based on customer requests. These includes new features to sequences such as the ability to make a choice, and management features such as being able to copy a sequence from one user to another.
