For the last few years, Software 6 classes have worked on a series of applications under the common name GIRAF. These applications are designed to help autistics and their guardians throughout their day.

 This report covers the development of the application Sekvens, designed to help autistics do series of activities through sequences of images. The program is taken from a state where it effectively was a standalone application, to a near final product, tied into the GIRAF solution.
 
 This includes coupling it up with the GIRAF launcher and a common database. Furthermore, there has been development of additional features based on customer requests. These includes new features to sequences such as the ability to make a choice, and management features such as being able to copy a sequence from one autistic to another.
