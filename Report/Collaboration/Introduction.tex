With GIRAF being a multi-project, it often made sense to work across groups. While all applications had their own purpose, many were connected in some way through the same dependencies or similar functionality. This provided options for collaborations where all participants could profit from it, and improve their own project for less effort. This chapter describes the collaborations Sekvens has been a part of.
