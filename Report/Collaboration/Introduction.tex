\section{Introduction}\label{sec:collab:Introduction}
With GIRAF being a multi-project, it often made sense to work across groups. While all applications had their own purpose, many were connected in some way through the same dependencies or similar functions. This gave grounds for some collaborations where often all participants could profit, improving their own project for less effort. This chapter describes the collaborations Sekvens has been a part of.
