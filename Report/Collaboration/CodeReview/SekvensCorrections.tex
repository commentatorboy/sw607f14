\subsection{Cat: looking through `Sekvens's code}\label{subsec:collab_sekvenscorrections}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Well structured. 	
	\item Generally a good use of methods.
	\item Better grouping of variables.
	\item Nested classes with some inappropriate intimacy.
	\item Some excessive use of literals instead of variables. 	
\end{itemize}
Generally the code made and edited by group sw607F14 were well structured and simple to read and understand. It had a good and appropriate use of methods, which made it easier to get an overview of the class. Furthermore these methods were of appropriate size.\\
Variables and their declaration could have been grouped better, such that related variables were placed together. This way it would have been easier to find certain variables, when trying to find a variable.\\
The class \ct{MainActivity} had two nested classes, which depended on variables from \ct{MainActivity}. These could be moved into separate files and made independent from the \ct{MainActivity} to avoid inappropriate intimacy among the classes.\\
When accessing other applications through Zebra, hardcoded literals where used to send data to the starting application. These literals could be made into variables, such that multiple equivalent literals could be avoided.
