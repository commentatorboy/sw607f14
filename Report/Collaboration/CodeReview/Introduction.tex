This section covers a two-way code review in collaboration with the CAT group. Both groups did a review of the Main Activities, the entry point for the applications.

For a collaborative part, it was chosen to perform a code review between sw609f14 (Cat) and sw607f14 (`Sekvens'). According to Wikipedia \cite{wiki-code-review}, code reviews can be done in several different ways, e.g. pair programming or informal walkthroughs. We adopted recommendations 2, 3, 4, and 7 from Cohen's practices \cite{s4-collab-cr-ibm}. We also applied the way ``Foredecker'' meet up again after reading through the code and discuss it \cite{s4-collab-cr-so}. Our primary focus was to keep it not too long, as to be able to maintain focus, as Cohen suggests in point 3 in his article.

Our goal with the code review was to get other people to look our code through, and find obvious errors the groups had stared themselves blinds on, as well as the general quality and readability of the source code, and if the structure of the source code - methods, classes, names - was meaningful.

Group sw607f14's finding in Cat's code are listed in section \ref{subsec:collab_catcorrections}, and group sw609f14's findings in `Sekvens' are listed in section \ref{subsec:collab_sekvenscorrections}. How the feedback was used, is described in section \ref{subsec:collab_sekvensresult} for `Sekvens', and section \ref{subsec:collab_catresult} for Cat.
