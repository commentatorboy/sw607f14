\section{SequenceViewer}\label{sec:sequenceviewer}

In this section we will discuss the different aspect of Sequence-Viewer, and what is the purpose of this application.

Sequence-Viewer is a new application made as a general activity which will show the sequences, which the user has added from other applications, for example Parrot, Sequence or Life-Stories.
Here are the requirements that the Sequence-Viewer should have:
\begin{itemize}
\item It should be able to show a choice between 2 or more pictograms which the autistic person should choose to do
\note{Add some pictures for this functionality please}
\item It should be able to show nested sequences, meaning that a pictogram can also be a whole sequence. When the autistic person presses the sequence it should open the sequence related to it.
\item It should be able to mark a pictogram as "done" by highlighting.
\item It should show a sequence of pictograms up to 7 at a time. This can be adjusted in the settings menu from each of the applications which Sequence-Viewer is opened from. For example Life-stories application.
\item It should be able to be viewed in landscape or portrait mode. This should also be in the settings activity.
\item It should be able to exit from Sequence-Viewer application and return to the previous activity.
\end{itemize}
