\section{Sprint Evaluation}\label{sec:spr2_spreval}
In this sprint we collaborated with the Life-stories group.
All groups got their official requirements and translated them into issues for this sprint.
We started with a new sideproject called "Sequence-Viewer", which should be a general template for showing a sequence, which has been dicussed here \note{Remember to have a ref to the new section about sequenceviewer}.
The Oasislib group did made some changes to their functionality therefore we had to adapt Sequence application to it.
We made many cosmetic changes and added some functionality. Which can be seen in \ref{subsec:spr2_resolved_issues}.
In the sprint-end demonstration the stakeholder questioned about the functionality for making a choice between pictograms and making nested sequences.
Therefore we have to specify what we actually mean with these functions.
Another important thing, is to make sure that the pictograms must not show only a part of its picture.
