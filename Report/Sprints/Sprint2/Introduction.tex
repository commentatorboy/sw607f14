\section{Introduction}
In sprint 2 we focused mainly on improving the design of Sequence. 
This means we also had to arrange meetings with other groups to discuss the user interface design of our applications. These other groups are the groups that have a similar interface as ours.
In this case we arranged meetings with Tortoise (also known as Lifestories), and an iOS group, which were developing all the applications for the Apple smartphone.
This chapter will discuss the process of organizing with the other groups, how we did it, what problems occurred, and how we solved them.
Another main task in this sprint for us was to synchronize with the internal database, and store sequences for each child onto the database. This was also discussed with the Lifestories group and iOS group. After the discussion, we gave our requirements for the database to the database group.
