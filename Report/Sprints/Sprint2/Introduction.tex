\section{Introduction}
In sprint 2 we focused mainly on improving the design of Sequence as well as plan for the future. 
This resulted in arranging meetings with other groups to discuss the user interface design of our applications. These other groups are the groups that have a similar interface as ours. In this case we arranged meetings with Tortoise (from the future called Lifestories), and the iOS group which were developing all the applications for the Apple products. We have described the collaborations in the section \ref{sec:sequenceviewer} about the Sequence Viewer and in section \ref{sec:database_planning} about the Database Planning. Another main task in this sprint was to figure out how to synchronize with the internal database, and store sequences for each child into the database. This was also discussed with the Lifestories, PiktoOplæser, and iOS groups and discussed in the section on Database planning.
