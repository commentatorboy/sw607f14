In sprint 2 we focused mainly on improving the design of Sequence as well as plan for the future. 
This resulted in arranging meetings with other groups to discuss the user interface design of our applications. These are the groups that have a similar interface to Sekvens. We arranged meetings with Livshistorier, and the iOS group. We have described the collaborations in chapter \ref{chap:collab}. Another main task in this sprint was to design the database for storing sequences. This was also discussed with the Lifestories, PiktoOpl√¶ser, and the iOS group. This is described in  section \ref{sec:database_planning}.
