\section{Project Planning}\label{spr1_projplan}
We took part in status-meetings for the entire multi-project, which had the job of keeping the multi-project on track and make decisions for the project as a whole. During this status-meeting the length of the first sprint was decided. We used this length to calculate the amount of hours available to burn during the sprint, and saved it in our issue tracker. At the status-meetings the groups also agreed on a focus for the first sprint. It was decided that the focus should be on resolving known issues from last semester, and fix bugs that made the applications unable to function.

We ran over the issues in our issue tracker and decided which to include in the sprint backlog for the first sprint. This decision was based on the hours estimated to resolve the issue, the priority for the issue, and the focus for the sprint. We favored issues with urgent or high priority for the first sprint. We choose roughly as many estimated hours of issues for the first sprint, as we calculated available hours to burn.
