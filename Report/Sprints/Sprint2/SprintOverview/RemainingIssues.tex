\subsection{Remaining Issues}
\label{subsec:spr2_RemainingIssues}
Here are the remaining issues that we did not make in this sprint.

\#1: Syncronization with the Database is still in process because changes will be made to the database, as we discussed in \ref{sec:collab}. \\
\#21: View-mode created is the new Sequence-Viewer application dicussed in \ref{sec:collab}.\\
\#25: Fix ADD/SAVE/BACK button in SequenceActivity is also because of the database is not done.\\
\#33: Nested Sequences, is almost done, but because we can not save sequences into the database yet, we can make this functionality 100\% done.\\
