\subsection{Remaining Issues}
\label{subsec:spr2_RemainingIssues}
Here are the remaining issues that we did not make in this sprint.

\begin{longtable} { | c | p{12cm} | c | } 
\hline
	ID 	&	Issues	&		 Es. hours \\\hline
	1	&	Syncronization with the Database 	&	32 hours	\\\hline
\label{tab:spr4_copyingsequences}
\end{longtable}

Syncronization with the Database is still in process because changes will be made to the database, as we discussed in \ref{sec:database_planning} We put this in the sprint because we thought sequences were already represented in the database.


\begin{longtable} { | c | p{12cm} | c | } 
\hline
	ID 	&	Issues	&		 Es. hours \\\hline
	21	&	View-mode created 	&	128 hours	\\\hline
\label{tab:spr4_copyingsequences}
\end{longtable}

The issue was created midway through sprint 2, and were under discussion for a while. The entire collaboration with LivsHistorier, PiktoOplaeser and the iOS group is described in section \ref{sec:collab}.\\

\begin{longtable} { | c | p{12cm} | c | } 
\hline
	ID 	&	Issues	&		 Es. hours \\\hline
	25	&	Fix ADD/SAVE/BACK button in SequenceActivity 	&	4 hours	\\\hline
\label{tab:spr4_copyingsequences}
\end{longtable}

This issue is still iced as the database synchronization is also iced.


\begin{longtable} { | c | p{12cm} | c | } 
\hline
	ID 	&	Issues	&		 Es. hours \\\hline
	33	&	Nested Sequences 	&	64 hours	\\\hline
\label{tab:spr4_copyingsequences}
\end{longtable}

Nested Sequences, is almost done, but because we can not save sequences into the database yet, we can make this functionality 100\% done.\\
