OasisLib, on which our project depends, received major updates in the beginning of sprint 2. This meant that our application no longer worked because certain dependencies was changed. Fixing Sequence to match the OasisLib-update mostly revolved around changed data-types, which had to be updated throughout the entire application.
The entire database does not support saving pictograms to sequences, so every sequence is saved as multiple pictogram IDs with their respective positions in the sequence.
