OasisLib received major updates in the beginning of sprint 2. This meant that our application no longer compiled as certain dependencies was changed. Modifying Sekvens to match the OasisLib update mostly revolved around changed data-types, which had to be updated throughout the entire application.
The database did as mentioned not support saving pictograms to sequences, so every sequence is saved as multiple pictograms with their respective positions in the sequence.
