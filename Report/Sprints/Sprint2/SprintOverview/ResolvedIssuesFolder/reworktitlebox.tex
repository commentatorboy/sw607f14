Changing the name of a sequence was originally not intuitive. It was in no way visible that the text field was editable, and by request of guardians this was changed. To make it intuitive we first made a button which would put the cursor in the text field and pop up the keyboard, but found that it was unnecessary cluttering of the screen. Later in the sprint this was reworked. Instead, the text field was given a plain white background and a frame similar to buttons, making it stand out as something that can be changed.
