The more independent users can easily handle sequences covering a larger timespan. These sort of sequences require a possibility to create nested sequences (e.g. a morning schema could entail smaller sequences such as eat breakfast, or take a shower). Furthermore it is sometimes when the autistics at institutions have a period of free time and they are presented with a choice (e.g. playing with cars or drawing).
This has been solved by allowing the guardian to fetch already created sequences, as well as choices, instead of only being able to add pictograms. As of the end of sprint 2 the database does not support full sequences which means the full functionality will not be added until sprint 3.
