\section{Product Backlog}\label{sec:spr1_prodback}
During the initial period of the first sprint, we analyzed the code and the report made last semester. This gave us insight in what we were going to work with, and we recorded their known issues and suggested future work. This was compiled down to a product backlog which we list below. The product backlog were made as a list of issues.
