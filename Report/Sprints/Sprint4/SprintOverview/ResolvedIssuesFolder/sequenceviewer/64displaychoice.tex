When looking through the sequence fetched (see issue 66 in table \ref{tab:spr4_SVdbSync}) we attach a \ct{onClickListener} to be able to display a choice. This is done by calling the method \ct{attachChoiceListener} to the pictogram placeholder for the choice. The placeholder may be a pictogram from the database, or it may be a temporary pictogram. In the current version of Sequenceviewer we use the pictogram shown in figure \ref{fig:choiceplaceholder} as choice placeholder.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Pics/Sprint4/questionwhite.png}}
	\caption{The current temporary choice-placeholder pictogram. This pictogram is used, unless another is defined in the fetched sequence.}
	\label{fig:choiceplaceholder}
\end{figure}

The \ct{attachChoiceListener} method attaches a click functionality to the choice holder pictogram, as well as define what should happen \ct{onClick}. \ct{onClick} will call the second method used for displaying choice called \ct{showChoiceDialog}. This method takes two parameters, the view that was clicked on and a reference to a \ct{Map<Integer, List<Integer>>} which contains the pictograms to display in the choice. See issue 66 in table \ref{tab:spr4_SVdbSync} to see how this \ct{Map} is created and filled.

The \ct{showChoiceDialog} method creates a new instance of the ChoiceDialog class, defined internally in the HorizontallyScroll and VerticallyScroll classes. ChoiceDialog takes 3 parameters in the constructor, the context of the \ct{onClick} view, the \ct{Map} with pictograms in the choice, and the \ct{onClick} view. It then proceeds to show the choiceDialog, when it is instantiated.

The \ct{ChoiceDialog} class defines the functionality inside the \ct{choice$\_$dialog}.xml-file. The xml-file is created much like landscape- and portraitmode, with a top-bar with text and a ScrollView below. We started off by inflating the choiceDialog, which displayed the choiceDialog as pop-up above the Sequenceviewer activity. We then target the LinearLayout in the \ct{choice$\_$dialog}.xml-file, because it is here we insert our pictograms. We also have to target the pictograms for this specific choice, as there may be multiple, therefore we use \ct{onClick} view and use its id to point to the right position in the \ct{Map}. Then we iterate over the pictograms in the choice and insert views in the choiceDialog. Just like in the dynamic show (see issue 47 in table \ref{tab:spr3_SVdynamicshow}) we scale the pictograms to fit the window. Lastly we attach \ct{onClickListeners} to every pictogram in the choiceDialog, because whichever pictogram may be clicked on, has to be returned to the position of the choice placeholder in the original sequence. We use the \ct{attachReturnPictogram} method which takes three parameters, the \ct{onClick} view, the choice placeholder view and the choiceDialog. The code can be seen in listing \ref{lst:SVchoiceDialog}, it uses same functionality as the code in listing \ref{lst:addPictogram}.

\begin{lstlisting} [caption={The constructor of ChoiceDialog sets up the pictograms and attaches onClickListeners}, label={lst:SVchoiceDialog}]
public ChoiceDialog(Context context, final Map<Integer,List<Integer>> pictogramMap, View choiceHolder) {
	super(context);
	this.SetView(LayoutInflater.from(this.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.choice_dialog, null));

	LinearLayout choiceDialogLayout = (LinearLayout) this.findViewById(R.id.GDialog_hsv_linlay);
	PictogramView tempView;
	PictogramView temp1View = (PictogramView)choiceHolder;
	List<Integer> pictogramArray = pictogramMap.get(temp1View.getId());

	for(int i = 0; i < pictogramArray.size(); i++) {
		tempView = new PictogramView(getContext(),16f);
		tempView.setId(i);
		pictogram = helper.pictogramHelper.getPictogramById(pictogramArray.get(i)).getImage();
		int limiter = Math.min(getWidth() / numberOfVisibiblePictograms, getHeight());
		Bitmap pictogramToDisplay = pictogramScaling(pictogram, limiter, false);
		tempView.setImageFromBitmap(pictogramToDisplay);

		choiceDialogLayout.addView(tempView);

		attachReturnPictogram(tempView, choiceHolder, this);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The ct{attachReturnPictogram} method targets two views, the \ct{PictogramView} which the customer must have clicked on, and the choice placeholder view. It then removes the choice placeholder view from the sequence, because now it is no longer a choice. It then removes the \ct{PictogramView} from the choiceDialog, and inserts it in the sequence at the position where the choice placeholder view was positioned before. Last, it dismisses the choiceDialog.  The code can be seen in listing \ref{lst:returnfromchoice}.

\begin{lstlisting} [caption={Attaches the onClickListeners, that ends the choice by removing the choice-placeholder and inserting the pictogram that was clicked on}, label={lst:returnfromchoice}]
private void attachReturnPictogram(View v, final View choiceHolder, final ChoiceDialog dialog){
	v.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
		@Override
		public void onClick(View v) {
			PictogramView temp = (PictogramView) v;
			PictogramView temp2 = (PictogramView) choiceHolder;
			mainLayout.removeView(temp2);
			LinearLayout mainLay = (LinearLayout) temp.getParent();
			mainLay.removeView(temp);
			mainLayout.addView(temp,temp2.getId());

			dialog.dismiss();
		}
	});
}
\end{lstlisting}

The functionality of a choice in Sequenceviewer can be seen in figure \ref{fig:choicepic1}, \ref{fig:choicepic2}, and \ref{fig:choicepic3}. The child first sees the sequence, then presses the choice and chooses which activity to perform, and then perform to complete the rest of the activities in the sequence.
