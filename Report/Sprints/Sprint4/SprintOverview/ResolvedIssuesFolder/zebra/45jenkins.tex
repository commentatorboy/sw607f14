From previous semesters it had been decided to use Jenkins to check whether applications compiles at any given time. Except from a very minor addition to the gradle build file, the only change needed to make Sekvens build successfully was covered in \ref{tab:spr4_refactoroverview} by removing submodules. One of these did not compile properly, which consequently meant that Jenkins registered the same for Sekvens, given that it was registered as a submodule.
