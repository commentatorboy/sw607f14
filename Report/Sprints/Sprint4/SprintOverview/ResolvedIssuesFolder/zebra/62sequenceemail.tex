This issue was a last minute decision to implement. During the fourth sprint both LivsHistorier and Sekvens performed usability tests, and all of the clients praised LivsHistoriers ability to send sequences through e-mail. The feature was requested Sekvens as well, and a small cooperation emerged. The code existing in LivsHistorier was practically copied, and slightly adjusted to match the existing code in Sekvens.
