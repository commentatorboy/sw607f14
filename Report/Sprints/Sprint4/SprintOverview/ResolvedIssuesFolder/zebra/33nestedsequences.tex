This is a reopened issue from sprint 2, and is described at table \ref{tab:spr2_nested}. As mentioned in the referenced section database synchronization was not completely implemented, so the time spent on this assignment at this sprint is refactoring it to save it. The \ct{sequence} model given by OasisLib had the list of frames, and these frames could have an int called \ct{nestedSequence}. This made it possible to easily use \ct{Frame} as the link between the sequences.
This also means that it is possible to nest sequences forever, and even circle nestings. Furthermore it is possible to alter/delete sequences nested in other sequences -meaning you indirectly alter the main sequence.
