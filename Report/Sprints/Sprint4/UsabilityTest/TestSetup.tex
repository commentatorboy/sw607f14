\subsection{Test Setup}\label{subsec:test_setup}

For this usability test, it was decided not to have a facilitator. We found that the tasks of the facilitator could be distributed between the test monitor and data logger. Furthermore, the suggested setup for the data logger was not possible. In lack of proper monitoring options, the data logger sat in the same room as the test subject and test monitor.

After the test, we did an analysis session to create the final list of issues that was found during the test. This list can be found in \ref{subsec:test_results}.

The list of tasks to be performed by the test subjects was defined beforehand in a way that makes the test subject use every aspect of Sekvens.
Test subjects was given information that we would like them to think aloud during the test and that the test monitor should not help them perform the tasks.
Furthermore, since the use of Sekvens included various fictive users, test subjects were informed about the name of their profile and the list of children they had access to administer.

The list of assignments can be found in \note{Make a ref to appendix}.
The test were performed on two test subjects. It should be noted that due to an unforeseen database change, the test unfortunately differed between the two tests. This means that the fictive names was different and that available pictograms had changed as well. The tests were the same, but program data was different.
