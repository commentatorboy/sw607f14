\section{Sprint Evaluation}
At the point of the deadline, Sekvens was fully functional, in that all features was working with the database. It was possible to copy, delete, create and edit sequences from within Sekvens. It was however also a turbulent finish to the sprint as some dependencies pushed breaking changes on the last day. This ultimately meant that a few workarounds had to be implemented in Sekvens to meet the deadline with a fully functional version. This is however not something that will affect end users, and is only noticable within the code.
SequenceViewer was especially under pressure, and as expected, some features could not be implemented. It was however functional and usable for all groups that had requested to use it.
