For the last sprint, the focus of Sekvens was to get everything working the now fully functional database from OasisLib. Furthermore we needed to implement a good way to copy and delete sequences. Being the last sprint, the main focus was however to ensure that it would work with the database.

For SequenceViewer, the main focus was the same. It had to be functional by the end of the sprint, at the very least to a degree where sequences could be displayed. Additional features would have to be a secondary priority, as the project had a hard deadline.
