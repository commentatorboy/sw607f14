\section{Analyzing the last Project}

The biggest part of the first sprint is acquiring an overview of the entirety of the application, this is done through analyzing the former groups issues, their report and the TODOs in their code. Furthermore creating issues and limiting us to a reasonable goal for the first sprint.
In the first sprint this section will be larger than the following couple of sprints, as there is a need for an understanding the project in connection with the multiproject.
