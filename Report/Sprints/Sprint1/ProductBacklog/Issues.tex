	ID 	&	Iced	&	Issues	&	Description		&	 Es. hours \\\hline
	1	& 	x	&	Syncronization with the Database		& 	Work together with the Database group to correctly link Sequence with the database - making extracting and saving images easier.	&	32 hours	\\\hline
	2	& 	x	&	Updating a picture in sequence -$>$; no update in overview	&	When opdating a picture in sequence, the picture is not shown in the overview.	&	8 hours	\\\hline

	4	& 		&	Home button pauses sequence -$>$ should destroy	 &	When pressing the home button on the tablet, it should destroy the application, and not pause it. For example it would be confusing, to open from paused state, instead of opening into the overview.	&	8 hours.	\\\hline

	7	& 		&	Marked pictogram not highlighted		&	When the pictogram is clicked it does not highlight.	&	8 hours 	\\\hline
	8	& 		&	Child mode needs to be more intuitive		&	Child mode relies on scrolling right now - we need to make it more intutive e.g. marked activities/pictograms as done. Overall the flow of child mode needs to be reworked	&	32 hours	\\\hline
	9	& 		&	Sequence does not look clickable		&	It is hard to see that you can click a sequence and choose to "open" it.	&	16 hours	\\\hline

	16	& 		&	It is possible to make identical sequences for the same child	&	Should be fixed, maybe as a check vs name and order of pictograms.	&	8 hours	\\\hline
	17	& 	x	&	Solve TODO in SequenceViewGroup - Can child be bigger than parent?	&	It is currently unknown whether a child can be bigger than the parent space allowed. Blocked because no images are available yet.	&	2 hours	\\\hline
