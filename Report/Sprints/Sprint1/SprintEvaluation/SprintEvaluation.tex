\section{Sprint Evaluation}\label{sec:spr1_spreval}
The first sprint was influenced by the start-up of the multi-project. Time was spent organizing groups, distributing subjects and researching previous work. The result of this research showed a running application for Sequences, but with limited functionality and missing connection with other multi-project subjects like the launcher and the local database. We collected issues for a product backlog which is displayed in tabel \ref{tab:spr1_prodblog}. We also gathered requirements to the Sequence application from previous semester. We also investigated further requirements to the application by compiling a series of questions and choices for the guardians to choose among, which we handed to the requirements-group to resolve. 

We resolved a list of issues during sprint 1, which can be seen in subsection \ref{subsec:spr1_resolved_issues}. How these issues were resolved are documented below each issues. Additionally, we attempted to resolve a list of issues but was unable to. These issue are described in subsection \ref{subsec:remain_issues}, and contains what we attempted to resolve the issue and why we did not resolve the issue.
