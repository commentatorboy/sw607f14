\section{Sprint Evaluation}\label{sec:spr1_spreval}
Sprint 1 was influenced by the startup of the multi-project. Time was spent organizing groups, distributing project and researching previous work. The result of this research showed a running application for creating sequences, but with limited functionality and missing connections with other multi-project projects like the Launcher and OasisLib. We collected issues for a product backlog which is displayed in table \ref{tab:spr1_prodblog}. We also gathered requirements to Sekvens from the previous semester. We also investigated further requirements to the application by compiling a series of questions and choices for the guardians to choose among, which we handed to the requirements-group to resolve (see Appendix \ref{app:reqquestion}). 

We resolved a list of issues during sprint 1, which can be seen in subsection \ref{subsec:spr1_resolved_issues}. How these issues were resolved are documented below each issue. The list of issues, which were not resolved are described in subsection \ref{subsec:remain_issues}, and describes why we did not resolve the issue.
