\subsection{Resolved Issues} \label{subsec:spr1_resolved_issues}
At the end of sprint 1, some of the existing issues in Sequence were resolved.
While most of the issues were easily fixed (\#6, \#10, \#14, \#20), there were also a few difficulties.

One was the task of resolving TODO's of the previous team who worked on the project. (\#11) They were usually very unclear, examples being "TODO ???" and "this is ridiculous". With statements being that vague and seemingly not meant for other teams to understand, made this a time expensive task. The estimate of 16 hours however fit surprisingly well for both analyzing and solving the issues. 

Another difficult task was debugging why the application was installed twice upon compiling. (\#19) Lack of knowledge about Android made this simple fix a long process to debug because we did not realize that the issue was not within the Sequence project, but one of its dependencies. Furthermore, another group was working simultaneously on the same issue, which was not discovered in the process. This happened because the time was spent trying to understand the issue. At that point it was a simple fix, and it was not before then it could be discovered that it was the same issue the other group was trying to solve.
