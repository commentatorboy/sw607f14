\subsection{Remaining Issues}
One of the remaining issues was the home button issue (see ID 4). It worked, but another problem occurred from it. 
When the user pressed the home button Sequence is closed and the process is killed. Although Sequence is killed, when opening the application again returns a failure, but when trying to open Sequence again, causes the application to open normally.
This issue should maybe be revised to do something else than just kill the application.
The launcher application ensures that when pressing the home button the person can choose to go to GIRAF or to the application panel in android.
Although as stated by the previous students in their report, \citep{Zebra}, the guardian was confused about when pressing the home button and opening the Sequence application again causes to start from the previous state, rather than going to the main overview page of Sequence.
