\subsection{Remaining Issues}
One of the remaining issues of sprint 1 was the home button issue (see ID 4). It worked, but another problem occurred from it. 
When the user pressed the home button Sequence is closed and the process is killed. Although Sequence is killed, when opening the application again it returns a failure and crashes. However, when trying to open Sequence again, the application to open normally.
Fixing this issue should maybe be revised to do something else than just killing the application.
The launcher application ensures that when pressing the home button the person can choose to go to GIRAF or to the application panel in android.
According to the previous report on Zebra, \citep{Zebra} the home button caused an issue. After using the home button, the guardian found it confusing when reopening Sequence, it resumed at the previous state of the application. It was preferred that the application should reopen as if it was just launched.
