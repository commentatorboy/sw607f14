\section{Project Management}\label{spr1_projmana}
We decided to use Scrum to manage our project. This meant that we held daily stand-up meetings to discuss what everyone was working on, how it was going and whether they needed something from the group to solve their assignment. Scrum required a product backlog to record the requirements to the product, those were decomposed into small issues. Scrum also required a sprint backlog, which held the issues planned for the current sprint. We used an issue-tracker called Redmine to manage this for the multi-project. We also used an internal group issue-tracker called AgileWrap, to keep track of the issues in the multi-project but also additional issues regarding research and so on. The issues from AgileWrap are not listed in this report.

We managed our sprint backlog for the first sprint ourselves, and for each issue recorded in the issue tracker we estimated the number of hours it would take to resolve the issue, and gave it a priority.
