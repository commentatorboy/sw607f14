\section{Project Planning}\label{spr1_projplan}
We took part in weekly status-meetings during the entire multi-project, which had the purpose of keeping the multi-project on track and make general decisions regarding GIRAF. During these status-meetings the length of each sprint was decided. We used the sprint length to calculate the amount of hours available to burn, and saved it in our issue tracker. At the status-meetings the groups also agreed on a focus for each sprint.

Before sprint 1 we ran over the issues in the existing issue tracker and decided on which to include in the sprint backlog for the first sprint. Furthermore we reviewed the code of Sekvens, and added issues as we stumbled upon them. The decision on what to include, was based on the hours estimated, the priority for the issue, and the focus for the sprint. We favored issues with urgent or high priority for sprint 1. We chose roughly as many estimated hours of issues as there were hours to burn.
