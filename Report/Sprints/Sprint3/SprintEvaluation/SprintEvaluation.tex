\section{Sprint Evaluation}
During the third sprint, a group member was forced to leave the group due to circumstances not within our control. This meant that from that point forward we had 1/4 hours less to work with.
As there at this point still were no database functionality to handle sequences, there was little more to do on Sekvens. For this reason a few old, low-priority issues was re-visited and successfully closed. This included the issue of killing the application if minimized, which also took longer than expected.

For Sequenceviewer, there was however plenty to work on. As a result, it made it to a state where it was a running as a very basic prototype, focus being foremost that it was functional. 
Near the end of the sprint it was announced that the database was ready to handle sequences, but at this point it was too late to change anything related to Sekvens for sprint 3.
We would also have liked to do usability tests in sprint 3, but according to the Requirements group, this was not possible. This was unfortunate, because delaying it to sprint 4 meant that there would be less time to correct any potential issues found under the usability test.
