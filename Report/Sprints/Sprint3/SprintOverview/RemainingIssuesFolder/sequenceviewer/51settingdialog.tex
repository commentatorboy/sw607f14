When issue 49 in appendix \ref{app:productbacklog} has been resolved, and issue 50 in table \ref{tab:spr3_SVarrowhighlight} has been polished and implemented, there has be to be made a setting for type of marker. This should be set up in the already existing settingsActivity which Sekvens and Livshistorier implements. Additionally, the code needs handle this, both in Sequenceviewer and the applications calling it should use it as intent.
