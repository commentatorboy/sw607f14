This issues springs of a requirement from the costumers that children should never be allowed to watch half pictograms. With this coming to our attention, we had to change it every where we show pictograms. We evaluate this to take a low amount of time, but was proven to be a harder task than expected. The issue has been moved to future work (see section \ref{sec:future_work} in the paragraph called \textbf{Snapping Scrollviews}).
