This issue is part of the clients requirements for the application. We initially gave it a low priority as we thought this requirement was sub-par. If a guardian wants to cancel or replace a pictogram, sequence or choice, they could simply create a new altered sequence or alter the existing one. In the end, the issue was closed as we believe the functionality was achieved through different ways.

This could be a project for future groups if the clients find the requirement fundamental enough to be an issue.
