This issue is part of the requirements the clients requirements for the application. We started of by giving this low priority as we thought this requirement was sub-par. If the clients wish to cancel or replace a pictogram, sequence or choice, they could simply create a new altered sequence or alter the existing one. In the end the issue was closed as we strongly believe the functionality was achieved through different ways.

This could be a project for future groups if the clients find the requirement fundamental enough to be in demand.
