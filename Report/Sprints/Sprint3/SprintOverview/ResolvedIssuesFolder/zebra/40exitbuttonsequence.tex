A request that the customers had for all applications within GIRAF, was that they should have an exit button. It should be noted that this is not intuitive from our point of view. Android handles the lifecycles of applications automatically\cite{Lifecycle} and the Back button can also perform the desired behavior. The exit button is redundant, but as it is both a customer request and decided upon in the other GIRAF applications, the button was created in Sekvens as well.
