At the beginning of sprint 3 we were aware that some groups were interested in having a shared viewer for their equivalents of sequences. The details were however very vague, and it was not known what the demands would be for such a viewer. Since there was not enough left in Sekvens for two more sprints, we agreed to be responsible for the viewer, which is when this issue was created.

Later in sprint 3 the details were sorted out under a collaboration meeting with the relevant groups. As the different groups needed support for different features, the viewer turned out to be a large component. For this reason, Sequenceviewer was given its own repository and a separate backlog, so that for all intents and purposes we could view it as a project on its own. This means that while this issue was closed, Sequenceviewer was a new project being started up.
