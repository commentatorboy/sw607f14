When the costumers was editing a sequence, they did not find it intuitive that you had to press the large `framed plus' at the end of the sequence as shown in figure \ref{fig:Old_editSequence}. Furthermore when you had a long sequence (above 4 pictograms), you would have to scroll in order to find the `plus button'. We decided to add an alternative to the already existing method, and added a simple button. This way the clients have multiple ways to edit the sequences, and could use whichever they see fit. The following figure \ref{fig:Old_editSequence} shows the \ct{sequenceGridView} in sequenceActivity.
