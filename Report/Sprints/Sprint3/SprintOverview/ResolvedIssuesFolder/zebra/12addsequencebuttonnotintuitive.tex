When the customers were editing a sequence, they did not find it intuitive that you had to press the large framed plus at the end of the sequence as shown in figure \ref{fig:Old_editSequence}. Furthermore when you had a sequence of more than 4 pictograms, you would have to scroll in order to find the plus. We decided to add an alternative to the already existing method, and added a simple button. This way the clients have multiple ways to edit the sequences, and could use whichever they see fit. Figure \ref{fig:Old_editSequence} shows the \ct{sequenceGridView} in sequenceActivity.
