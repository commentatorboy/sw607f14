This issue involved the previous issue with dynamic show seen in table \ref{tab:spr3_SVdynamicshow}. Because the dynamic show had the desired variability, there had to be a setting to tell Sequenceviewer how many pictograms to display. This issue can, as well as issue 47, be found in appendix \ref{app:reqgroup1}. The issue is solved by receiving an intent from the application calling Sequenceviewer, with the desired number of visible pictograms. This can be seen among other intents, in listing \ref{lst:svIntents}.

\begin{lstlisting} [caption={Intent from the calling application}, label={lst:svIntents}]
//intent fra caller-app (Parrot/Zebra/Tortoise)
sequenceId = extras.getInt("sequenceId");
landscapeMode = extras.getBoolean("landscapeMode");
numberOfVisibiblePictograms = extras.getInt("visiblePictogramCount");
type = extras.getString("callerType");
