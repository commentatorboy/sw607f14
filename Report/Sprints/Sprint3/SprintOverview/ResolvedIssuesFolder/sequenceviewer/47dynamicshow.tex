As described in the product backlog for this issue, the Sequenceviewer needs to be able to vary the number of pictograms it will display. This issue originates from work done by the requirements group during the GIRAF multiproject, and it can be seen in the requirement-report in appendix \ref{app:reqgroup1}. The reason for this issue comes from the difference in the abilities that the children posses. Some children can only perform one task at a time, and having the next activity to look at, while other children may be capable of seeing the entire sequence of activities. The different institutions who will work with this system, also has varying children with varying strengths.

The varying number of pictograms to display, will be based on a setting provided by the application calling Sequenceviewer.
