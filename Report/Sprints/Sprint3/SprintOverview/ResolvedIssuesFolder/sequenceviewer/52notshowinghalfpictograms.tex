This issue comes from feedback given by the requirements group in appendix \ref{app:reqanswer}. The feedback was an answer to questions stated in the requirements report seen in appendix \ref{app:reqquestion}. It may be difficult for some children to see half pictograms, because they are unable to handle changes or something they do not understand. 

We decided to solve this issue by using a snap-effect. This snap-effect was to be made as an extension to the already existing Android \ct{ScrollView} and \ct{HorizontalScrollView}. We collaborated with the GComponents group ()see section \ref{collaborationSnapper}), because this functionality could be useful for other applications in the GIRAF multi-project. As can be seen in \ref{collaborationSnapper}, we made a formal request for the functionality.

The solution to this issue looks as follows for HorizontalScrollView:
\begin{lstlisting} [caption={Snap-effect for HorizontalScrollView}, label={lst:snapHSV}]
import dk.aau.cs.giraf.gui.GHorizontalScrollViewSnapper;
public class HorizontallyScroll extends GHorizontalScrollViewSnapper
\end{lstlisting}

And the solution looks as follows for ScrollView, which is the equivalent for vertical scrolling:
\begin{lstlisting} [caption={Snap-effect for ScrollView}, label={lst:snapVSV}]
import dk.aau.cs.giraf.gui.GVerticalScrollViewSnapper;
public class VerticallyScroll extends GVerticalScrollViewSnapper
\end{lstlisting}
