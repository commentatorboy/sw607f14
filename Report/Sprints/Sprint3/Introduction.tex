\section{Introduction}
For the third sprint, the focus of development changed to focus more on SequenceViewer as this would be a dependency for other groups as well as ours. As this had only just been decided in sprint 2, it was a project that had to be started up from scratch. For SequenceViewer, sprint 3 thus revolved around setting up the core of the activity. For Sekvens, the focus mostly revolved about polishing the application, preparing it as well as possible for the upcoming database support.
